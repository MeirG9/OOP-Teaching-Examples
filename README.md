# OOP Teaching Examples

This repository contains a series of Python code examples designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each stage introduces a new concept, building on the previous one to gradually increase understanding and complexity.

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Object-Oriented Programming
This stage introduces the basics of OOP, including class and object creation.

[View Code](https://github.com/MeirG9/OOP-Teaching-Examples/blob/main/Basic%20OOP.py)

### Stage 2: Inheritance
This stage demonstrates inheritance, showing how a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.

### Stage 3: Abstract Class
This stage introduces abstract classes and methods, explaining how to define and use them.

### Stage 4: Polymorphism
This stage covers polymorphism, showing how methods can be overridden in derived classes to provide specific implementations.

### Stage 5: Encapsulation and Composition
This stage explains encapsulation and composition, demonstrating how to use private attributes, getter and setter methods, and how to compose objects.

### Final Stage: All Features Together
This final stage combines all the features into a comprehensive example, illustrating how they work together in a complete program.
